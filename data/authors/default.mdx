Paul Frazee is a software engineer at Bluesky. He leads the team building the [Bluesky social application](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app) and is frequently working with React Native. Paul co-authored the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com).

Previously Paul was one of the early developers of [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Scuttlebutt) peer-to-peer social network, largely working in the application and DX. Paul then created the [Beaker Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_(web_browser)), a peer-to-peer Web browser, and was heavily involved in the Dat/Hypercore protocol's development. Afterwards, Paul [live-streamed the entire development](https://www.youtube.com/@paul_frazee/videos?view=2&sort=dd&live_view=503&shelf_id=0) of yet another distributed social network called CTZN.

Paul was not trained for any of this.
